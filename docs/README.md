# LLMos Documentation for Makers

Welcome! This is your guide to building AI robots and smart devices.

## Start Here

New to LLMos? Start with these guides in order:

1. **[Getting Started](architecture/HELLO_WORLD_TUTORIAL.md)** - Your first 10 minutes with LLMos
2. **[ESP32 Setup](hardware/ESP32_GUIDE.md)** - Connect your hardware
3. **[Robot Programming](architecture/ROBOT4_GUIDE.md)** - Make your robot move

## What's a "Guide"?

Think of these as recipes for building cool stuff:

### For Beginners
- **Getting Started** - Try LLMos in 10 minutes (no hardware needed!)
- **ESP32 Setup** - Connect a tiny computer to make things move
- **Desktop App** - Install LLMos on your computer for faster builds

### For Building Robots
- **Robot Programming** - Make robots move, sense, and think
- **ESP32 Guide** - Deep dive into robot hardware

### Understanding How It Works
- **Project Structure** - Where everything lives
- **LLM Configuration** - Set up your AI assistant

## What You Can Do

### Without Any Hardware
- Create virtual robots in the desktop app
- Test obstacle avoidance
- Try line following
- Build maze solvers
- Make interactive apps

### With an ESP32 Board ($10)
- Blink LEDs
- Read sensors
- Control motors
- Make sounds
- Build actual robots!

## Quick Links

**Just want to build?**
- [Getting Started](architecture/HELLO_WORLD_TUTORIAL.md) - Start here!
- [ESP32 Setup](hardware/ESP32_GUIDE.md) - Hardware guide

**Want to understand how it works?**
- [Robot Programming](architecture/ROBOT4_GUIDE.md) - How robots think
- [Desktop App Guide](guides/DESKTOP.md) - About the desktop version

**Having trouble?**
- Check [ESP32 Guide troubleshooting](hardware/ESP32_GUIDE.md#troubleshooting)
- Ask on [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/EvolvingAgentsLabs/llmos/discussions)

## The Basic Idea

1. You describe what you want in plain English
2. LLMos writes the code for you
3. Test it in a virtual robot first
4. Upload to your real ESP32 (if you have one)
5. Watch it work in the real world!

## Tips for Success

1. **Read "Getting Started" first** - It's quick and easy
2. **Try virtual robots** - No hardware needed to learn
3. **Start simple** - Blink an LED before building a maze solver
4. **Ask for help** - The community is friendly!

## Common Questions

**Do I need to be a programmer?**
Nope! LLMos writes code for you. But you'll learn as you go.

**Do I need to buy stuff?**
Not to start! Try virtual robots first. An ESP32 is $10 if you want real hardware later.

**What if I get stuck?**
Check the troubleshooting sections in each guide, or ask on GitHub.

**Can kids use this?**
Yes! Great for ages 10+ with some adult help.

## Next Steps

1. Read [Getting Started](architecture/HELLO_WORLD_TUTORIAL.md)
2. Try creating a virtual robot
3. If you like it, get an ESP32 board
4. Build something cool!
5. Share what you made!
