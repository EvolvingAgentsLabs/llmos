Scenario: Multiple Obstacles Scattered
Robot Position: (0, -2.0) facing North (rotation = PI/2)
Map: standard5x5Obstacles - 5m x 5m arena with 12 obstacles distributed across quadrants

I need the description of the scene for robot navigation, try to describe the objects, sizes, direction and distance.

Context: The robot is at the bottom-center facing north into an arena with multiple obstacles. The central large obstacle (radius 0.35m) is at (0,0), approximately 2.0m ahead. Two mid-range obstacles at (0, -1.2) radius 0.12m and (-1.2, 0) radius 0.12m may be visible. The floor grid (0.5m spacing) is visible. This is a complex scene requiring careful path planning.
