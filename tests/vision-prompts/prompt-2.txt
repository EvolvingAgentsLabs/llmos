Scenario: Single Obstacle Directly Ahead
Robot Position: (0, -1.0) facing North (rotation = PI/2)
Map: 5m x 5m arena with a large central obstacle at (0, 0) radius 0.35m

I need the description of the scene for robot navigation, try to describe the objects, sizes, direction and distance.

Context: The robot is 1.0m south of the arena center, facing north directly toward a large cylindrical obstacle (radius 0.35m) at the center. The obstacle is approximately 1.0m away (2 grid squares). The floor grid is visible with 0.5m spacing. The obstacle has red-and-white diagonal stripes.
