  "sceneDescription": "Two medium red-and-white striped cylindrical obstacles form a narrow corridor directly ahead. The left obstacle (0.5m diameter) is approximately 1.1m away, center-left. The right obstacle (0.5m diameter) is approximately 1.1m away, center-right. The gap between them is approximately 0.7m (about 1.4 grid squares wide). Beyond the corridor, open space is visible. The floor grid with 0.5m spacing helps gauge the passage width — it is slightly wider than 1 grid square.",
  "navigationAdvice": "Narrow corridor ahead (approximately 0.7m gap). Proceed carefully through the center, maintaining equal distance from both obstacles. The passage is navigable but requires precise alignment.",
  "gridReference": "Floor grid visible between the two obstacles. The gap spans approximately 1.4 grid squares (0.7m). Each obstacle is about 2 grid squares ahead. Grid lines confirm alignment for passing through the center.",
