# System Memory Log - Experience Repository

This file records the outcomes of all tasks performed across all projects in LLMos-Lite, creating a basis for continuous learning and improvement.

Each entry represents a complete task execution with structured metadata and qualitative learnings.

## Example Experiences

---
- **experience_id**: exp_000_example
- **project_name**: example_signal_processing
- **primary_goal**: Create sine wave signal and apply FFT analysis
- **final_outcome**: success
- **components_used**: [SystemAgent, Python Execution, File System]
- **files_created**: 9
- **output_summary**: Successfully created signal_fft_analysis project with Python code, visualizations, and documentation
- **execution_time_ms**: 12500
- **learnings_or_issues**: Standard project structure (components/, output/, memory/) works well. Python execution with scipy/matplotlib in browser is reliable. Organizing outputs by type (code/, visualizations/, data/) improves clarity.
- **timestamp**: 2024-01-15T10:30:00Z

*New experiences will be appended below by the SystemAgent after each successful task completion...*
